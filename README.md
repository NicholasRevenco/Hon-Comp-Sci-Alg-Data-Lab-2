Name: Homework Night

Purpose: This is a text-based interactive game known as "Homework Night" where you, the student, is situation in a dark room and need to manage your time before starting the day. As part of the night, you are required to eat sleep, and complete your homework before going to school the next day. Set in a quiet night where the serenity outside contrasts with the mental activity within the room, you have to navigate through the options, grappling with the realistic trade-offs between nourishment, rest, and academic diligence, all enveloped in a ticking clock racing towards a new day.
